This is the parent repo for a LAP-1 Group project: Fact-ori. This is a community fact sharing site that has the following functionality for users: 
- Users are able to visit the website and anonymously post fact entries.
- Users are able to add gifs from [giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide) in an entry using the giphy API.
- Users are able to view other peoples' entries.
- Users are able to be able to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.
- Users are able to have three emojis to choose from.
- Users are able to be able to comment on other people’s entries.

The website is deployed using Netlify for client & Heroku for server. The data sent and stored in the backend is saved within .json files. Some funcitionality on the client side has been left as future features, such as the sort by, tags and shuffle facts.
